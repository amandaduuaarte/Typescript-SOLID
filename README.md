## TypeScript-SOLID

### Practical project developed with the aim of definitively understanding all SOLID concepts

### How i did ?

- First I started my code just for it to be functional and then I divided the responsibilities and refactored according to each SOLID principle.

### What is the project idea:

- The idea was that it would simulate the creation of a purchasing system, dividing responsibilities into classes, creating abstractions and much more.
